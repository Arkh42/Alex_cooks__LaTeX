Alex_cooks__LaTeX - Templates / Documents
=========================================



LaTeX documents are files with **.tex** extension.
After compilation, a **.pdf** file is generated.
(For old-fashioned LaTeX users, a *.dvi* file can also be generated.)

LaTeX documents have two parts:
1. the preamble, in which you load a class and several packages, and
2. the document content, in which you have your text.

The preamble is always the same.
So a template is convenient to avoid writing the same stuff again and again.
For beginners, it can be tricky, because some packages are compiler-dependent.
(If you have no idea about what I'm talking about, I advise you to have a look at
Tutorials/NAME_TO_BE_FOUND, which is dedicated to the topic.)
