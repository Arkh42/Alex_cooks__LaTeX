==================================================

Packages are files with **.sty** extension.
Classes are files with **.cls** extension.

From 
[clsguide â€“ Documentation of LaTeX class and package writing](https://ctan.org/pkg/clsguide),
> If the commands could be used with any document class, then make them a package;
> and if not, then make them a class.

Shortly, packages and classes are useful to:
- build/load tools dedicated to specific use like mathematics and drawings (packages),
- create layouts that will be automatically set (classes).
