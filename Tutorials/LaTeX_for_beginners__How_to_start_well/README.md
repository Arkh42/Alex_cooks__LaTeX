LaTeX for beginners: how to start well?
=======================================

Tags: **_<font style="color:red">newbie</font>_**.



LaTeX is powerfull, but not easy to start.
It's not that the tool is very complex.
It's just that:
1. the documentation is so big that it's not easy to find your way, and
2. there is a lot of bullshit and patch-up job that makes it weird when you start.

So here we are.
I claim that with this tutorial, you will quickly start and you will do it properly.
*Like a boss*, you will say.

Learn how to install LaTeX, i.e.,

an *editor* (program which simplifies the LaTeX writing).
