Step 1: install LaTeX
=====================



How

### 1. Choose a distribution

Three well-known LaTeX distributions:
1. [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/),
2. [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/),
3. [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/).

The following table summarizes the compatibility with the main Operating Systems (OS).

|	OS		|	TEX Live	| MiKTEX	| MacTEX	|
| :------:	|	:------:	| :------:	| :------:	|
|	Windows	|	V 			|	V 		| 	x 		|
|	Linux	|	V 			|	V 		|	V 		|
|	MacOS	|	x 			|	V 		|	V 		|

I don't have experience with MacOS. Sorry for Mac users.
For both Windows and Linux, I recommend the use of [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/),
which is more complete and more stable from my experience.


### 2. Choose an editor

Three LaTeX editor that I tried or eared of:
* [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/),
* [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/index_fr.html),
* [TeXnicCenter](http://www.texniccenter.org/).

The following table summarizes the compatibility with the main Operating Systems (OS).

|	OS		|	TeXstudio	| Texmaker	| TeXnicCenter	|
| :------:	|	:------:	| :------:	| :------:		|
|	Windows	|	V 			|	V 		| 	V 			|
|	Linux	|	V 			|	V 		|	x 			|
|	MacOS	|	V 			|	V 		|	x 			|

Your choice is really a matter of taste.
I encourage you to try several editors.
Personnally, I'm using [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/).
