Alex_cooks__LaTeX - Tutorials
=============================



If you want to learn LaTeX, or any tool that you don't know, you have two possibilities:
1. you open the manual and start to read hundreds of pages until you completed master the subject, or
2. you learn by small pieces that you practice immediately and you build your knowledge step by step.

I think that I know LaTeX quite well, and probably better that lots of people who write about it on the Internet.
I have used it extensively.
I went deep into how it works.
I wrote many classes and packages.
I maintained a lecture about LaTeX at my University.
And still, I know I don't master it at 100%.
So, if you want the first method, I'm sorry to disappoint you.
However, I'm convinced that I can help you to learn step by step, topic by topic, until a quite advanced use.

Hence, **tutorials are divided in modules dedicated to specific goals**.
